# Tic Tac Toe

This is the 5th javascript project from theodinproject curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript). 

The goals of this project were to implement the module design pattern and factory functions to better organise my code, introduce the concepts of public and private scope, minimise the use of global scope, and further my understanding of objects. Having completed the project, I feel like this was a very good introduction to these concepts. The best way to learn is by doing, and I ran into problems when trying to implement these ideas. It was in the resolution of these problems that I gained a more solid understanding of these concepts.
